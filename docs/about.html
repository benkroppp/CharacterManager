                    This project was inspired by my friend group's recent D&D 5e campaigns and stories. I decided to make a webpage that allowed me to keep track of characters and their initiative order.

                    I will eventually add more features, as well as more races, classes, and the ability to keep track of multiple characters. I may eventually add the ability to keep track of multiple initiative orders in multiple campaigns as well.

                    Hopefully I will also be able to add the ability to keep track of level, health, feats, weapons and spells.
