# CharacterManager
A DND Character Creator and Manager
This would be a tool for DND players to create and manage characters. I would likely implement an API to get the spells, classes, and items listed, and would likely have to implement a more basic version of the tool at first in order to make the final due date. I chose this as my final project because my friends and I play DND and I thought it would be fun to make a tool to keep track of the party.
List of planned features:
1. Character Creator
2. Character Manager (level up, add items, etc)
3. Initiative Tracker (allows the DM to keep track of the order in which combat is happening)
4. Spell List (allows player to see which spells are available)
Week By Week Plan
Week 1: Basic HTML/CSS/JS to get a feel for how the pages will look
Week 2: Initiative Tracker/Spell List/LocalStorage framework
Week 3: Character Creator
Week 4: Character Manager
